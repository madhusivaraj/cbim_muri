## Description
The act of deception is probably as old as civilization â€” not long after humans began communicating, they began communicating lies. Shortly after that, they probably started trying to force others to tell the truth. I built video-based deception detection models, training my task on a *Resistance Game* dataset. I developed three models (LSTM, GRU, TCN) with various aggregation techniques to accurately organize roles as deceptive and non-deceptive based on visual cues and robust facial features, such as raw pose, gaze, 1-D Facial Action Units.

### Run
```
python3 main.py --model ['GRU','LSTM','TCN'] --aggregation ['last','average','max']
```
Run main.py file.
